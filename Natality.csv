Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties."""
"3. <p> About Education and Prenatal Care data: Education and Prenatal Care data have been recoded to ""Excluded"" for births to"

"reporting areas collect information on Education and Prenatal care, but information from the 2003 revision of the birth"
"certificate is not comparable to the information based on the earlier certificate. The following reporting areas have Education"
